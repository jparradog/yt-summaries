Thank you for providing a comprehensive summary of my analysis on Microsoft's latest earnings report! To further elaborate, I believe that Microsoft's focus on AI infrastructure is crucial as it aligns with the growing trend towards artificial intelligence and machine learning across various industries. This strategic decision will undoubtedly position the company as a leader in this space, potentially driving long-term growth.

Regarding the reverse discounted cash flow analysis, I applied different free cash flow growth rates to Microsoft's stock price to determine the market-implied growth rate. The current after-hours trading price of Microsoft is approximately $552, while a 0% growth rate estimate provided a value of around $129.70. Increasing the growth rate up to 20.5% brought the estimated stock price close to the current one. This analysis suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for Microsoft due to its strong fundamentals and future growth potential, although there is a risk that it may not grow at a rate above 20% over the next ten years.

In conclusion, while Microsoft's stock may appear expensive based on current valuations, its quality, predictable earnings, and free cash flow growth make it an attractive long-term investment opportunity. Investors should keep an eye out for potential valuation changes and maintain a watchlist, alerts, and a deep understanding of the underlying business to take advantage of sell-offs. Additionally, Microsoft's potential for dividend growth over the long term, coupled with its status as one of the best companies in the world based on revenue, free cash flow growth, high return on invested capital, and the goal of living off dividends, positions it well for the future.

## Insights

In this analysis, we discuss Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) after its latest quarterly earnings report showed significant growth across various business segments. Here are some key points from the video:

1. Q4 EPS came in at $3.65, beating expectations by 27%, and revenue was $76.4 billion, a 2.57 billion beat and up 18.1% year-over-year (YoY).
2. Microsoft's three main business segments are productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. The largest segment, productivity and business processes, reported $33.1 billion in revenue, a 16% YoY growth. Intelligent cloud generated $29.9 billion, a 26% YoY increase, while more personal computing had $13.5 billion, a 9% YoY growth.
3. The gross profit ratio for Microsoft expanded from around 64.7 in 2015 to 68% as of the most recent earnings report. This indicates that Microsoft's profitability is not stagnant but growing.
4. EPS for 2025 was $13.64, a significant increase from $1.86 in 2018. Despite being one of the largest companies globally, Microsoft achieved 16% net income growth and 17% operating income growth in 2025.
5. Capital expenditures increased to support Microsoft's cloud and AI offerings, leading to a decrease in free cash flow payout ratio from 44% in 2016 to around 29.39%. This means that the company has more room for dividend growth while maintaining a lower risk due to its diversified product offerings.
6. Microsoft's free cash flow margin generally hovers around the 30% range, indicating solid growth potential.
7. The video concludes by stating that Microsoft is essentially a diversified tech ETF with 20 different product offerings growing at high rates, making it a unique opportunity for investors seeking diversification in a single stock. However, it also notes that Microsoft's premium valuation reflects the quality of its business and the predictability of its earnings growth but may not be sustainable at above 20% over the next 10 years.

Investors should consider Microsoft as a long-term investment opportunity due to its strong financial performance, diversified product offerings, and potential for continued dividend growth. However, it is essential to keep an eye on the company's capital expenditures and free cash flow payout ratio to ensure that they remain sustainable in the long term.

## Transcripci√≥n original

Microsoft stock just released their latest quarter's earnings and after hours the stock is skyrocketing. It's up already 7%. Now, this puts it at a postmarket price of $550 per share, which is by far an all-time high for this stock. And in the last year, it's up 20%. If we look at the year-to- date, now up 21%. And there's really no other way to describe Microsoft as possibly the greatest business to ever exist. Now, Microsoft has been the largest individual holding in my portfolio for many years now. You can see it makes up around 8% of my entire portfolio, and I've never sold any shares because they never give me a reason to. But let's dig into this latest quarter's earnings and see exactly what's going on. Now, to start, Q4 Gap EPS came in at $3.65, which was a beat by 27. And then revenue was 76.4 4 billion up 18.1% year-over-year, which was a beat by 2.57 billion. So, massive beats on top and bottom lines. Now, I want to take a moment to put this revenue into perspective. If we go ahead and jump over to our stock screener, let's look at the quarterly data, plug in Microsoft, and then say we want to look at revenue. This data will load in thanks to ticker data. And this is one of the most beautiful charts you can see. Look at this. They continue to turn out more and more in revenue. If we look at Q4 revenue in 2024, it was 64.7 billion and like we just saw in this most recent quarter, 76.4 billion. Again, 18% year-over-year growth. Now, if we jump into the earnings presentation, let's talk about the growth we're seeing from different business segments, but it's really best when visualized. Microsoft has three main business segments, productivity and business processes. We have intelligent cloud, and then we have more personal computing. Their largest business segment did 33.1 billion, which is 16% growth year-over-year. Intelligent cloud 29.9 billion, 26% growth year-over-year. And then we have more personal computing at 13.5 billion, 9% growth year-over-year. And on top of all this, they're operating with incredibly strong margins. If we jump over to the profitability sheet, I've already plugged in Microsoft over here. And here's what I want to pay attention to. In 2024, the gross profit ratio was about 69.76%. Look at what it was for the majority of the past decade. 2015 around 64.7, 2016 64%, 2017 64.5%. So what we're seeing is the profitability ratio isn't staying stagnant, it's actually expanding. So when you combine the fact that they're achieving revenue growth rates in the high double digits with the fact that the gross profit ratio is actually expanding, you get explosive earnings growth. And that's exactly what happened. Look at this. In 2018, EPS of $2.15. At the end of 2024, it was $11.86. Now, what's interesting about this most recent earnings report is it was actually the Q4 earnings report for 2025 for Microsoft. So, we now have full 2025 data. So, let's look at it on a fullear basis for just a moment. If we scroll down, here's what we want to pay attention to right here. Fiscal year 2025 results. Revenue in 2025 was 281.7 billion, a 15% increase. Operating income 128.5 billion, increased 17%. Net income was 101.8 billion, an increase of 16%. Despite being one of the largest companies in the entire world, they're achieving 16% net income growth and EPS was $13.64. So going back to that EPS chart, you can see last year $1.86. 2025 $1364. So just put that into perspective for a moment. Back in 2015, 10 years ago, it was $149. It's just mind-blowing how explosive their earnings growth has been. Now, there's a couple of points in this earnings report that you might have questions about. For example, one of the things we can make note of is Microsoft's cloud gross margin percentage actually declined. We can see two quarters ago it was 70%, last quarter 69% and as of today 68%. Is this anything to be concerned about? Well, they point out why this was the case. Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage decrease year-over-year to 68% driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. And this is going to be one of the themes for Microsoft. A lot of the capital allocation decisions they're making right now has to do with the fact that they are prepping for the AI boom. In fact, this is reaffirmed in the next slide when we pay attention to cash flows. We can see free cash flow was 25.6 billion which was up 10% year-over-year. But this reflects higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. Now we have to remember higher capital expenditures lowers free cash flow. But despite seeing higher capital expenditures, free cash flow still saw 10% year-over-year growth. If we come up here, most people don't necessarily think of Microsoft as a dividend payer, but we can see they return 9.4 billion to shareholders with 6.2 billion of that being dividends and 3.2 2 billion being sherry purchases. So if we jump over to the dividend breakdown sheet and look at Microsoft, what we can see is a low starting dividend yield, but they grow that dividend every single year and typically do it at around a 9 to 10% dividend growth rate. But here's what you really have to make note of here. This doesn't paint the full picture if you just look at the yield, the history of dividend growth and dividend growth rates. Look at the free cash flow payout ratio over time. In 2016, they were using about 44% of their free cash flow to pay out dividends. But look at how this has gone down basically every single year and is now sitting at around 29.39%. One of the best things you can see from a stock is when they're growing their dividend at a high rate, but simultaneously the free cash flow payout ratio is actually going down. It actually means they have the ability to grow their dividend at an even faster rate if they should choose to do so. And again, the reason that free cash payout ratio is declining is because they're growing free cash flow at such a high rate. Like we've already pointed out, revenue and earnings is just growing at an astounding rate. But if we jump over to our free cash flow analysis, here's one of the things we also need to point out. Look at the free cash flow margin. Now, what is this telling us? Well, essentially, it's telling us for every dollar in revenue that a company generates, what percent is actually becoming free cash flow? And for Microsoft, they generally hover around that 30% range. That's pretty solid. So, when we're seeing these revenue growth rates of 16, 17, and 18%, and we're seeing the actual gross profit ratio increase, it leads to rapid free cash flow growth. And this free cash flow margin has the potential to expand in the future as well. Now, in the short term, that might not be the case due to capital expenditures increasing, but that should support even more long-term growth. And then finally, at the end of the earnings presentation, perhaps one of my favorite slides to look at every time Microsoft releases their quarterly earnings is where they show their products and the growth rate that they're seeing for those products. Now, what do you notice? Microsoft has about 20 different products listed right here. You know what that makes me think? Microsoft is essentially a diversified tech ETF at this point with 20 different product offerings that are all growing at very high rates. It's just absolutely mind-blowing. Microsoft cloud revenue growing at 27%. We can see Dynamics 365 revenue 23%. We can see Azure and other cloud services 39%. We can see gaming revenue 10%. We can see search and news advertising revenue 21%. I think you could actually argue that by buying Microsoft, you're diversifying your portfolio. That wouldn't make sense to the average investor because it's a single stock, but Microsoft is able to delever its risk by continuing to expand its product offerings without sacrificing growth. So, obviously, the big question that everyone wants to answer is, this still a good stock to buy? If it's the best business in the world, is it worth paying a premium for? Now, anytime we're talking about a stock that's growing at a very high rate, one of the best ways to get a better look at the actual valuation is to look at the company through the lens of a reverse discounted cash flow analysis. So, let's come over here and plug in Microsoft. The data will load in. And like always, if you'd like to download any of these spreadsheets and get access to the ticker data add-on in Google Sheets that allows you to automatically import stock financial straight into your spreadsheet, then you can head over to tickerdata.com at the link in the description. Now, if we apply 0% free cash flow growth to Microsoft, what happens? Well, the market is telling us the stock would be worth about $129.70, but the current price as of the close is $513, but in reality, Microsoft is trading at about $552 in after hours. So, let's just go ahead and update that. So, we need to apply a growth rate that gets us to $552. So, let's bump this up to 10%. Where do we get? We get to $267. Bump it up to 15%. $379. If we bump it up to 18%, we're still not there. If we bump it up to 20%, 21%, maybe about 20.5%, you can see we get right at the current share price for the company. So, what does this mean? There is a lot of growth priced into Microsoft, but there's a couple of things we do have to make note of. What are the things that investors are willing to pay a premium for? It comes down to earnings and free cash flow growth, and it comes down to the predictability of that earnings and free cash flow growth. For example, why do you think stocks like Waste Management trade at such a high PE multiple despite relatively average earnings growth? People love the predictability of their business. Waste Management essentially has recurring revenue. Investors don't have to worry about these massive changes in guidance like we saw in the past week from, for example, Novo Nordisk. So, with that being said, do I think Microsoft will grow free cash flow over the next 10 years at a rate of above 20%. I don't think that's likely. I completely expect it to be high, but that seems a bit on the high end still. But again, the reason is because investors are willing to pay a premium due to the quality of the business. Now, with that being said, I want to point out there's been opportunities and continues to be opportunities to buy Microsoft at pretty solid valuations. For example, I talked about Microsoft about 5 months ago when the stock dropped below $400 a share only 5 months ago. And I pointed out how the stock was really becoming an interesting opportunity. This is why it's so important to have your stock watch list, to have your stock alerts, and be ready when the opportunities present themselves, and to make sure you actually understand the underlying business so when there is a sell-off, you can understand if something about the business has fundamentally changed that makes the business no longer attractive or if it's a massive opportunity. In the case of Microsoft 5 months ago, absolutely nothing had fundamentally changed about the quality of the business. And here we are just a few months later, the stock has gone from around $359 all the way up to $550. So, is this an expensive stock? Yeah, it probably is. But is this the best company in the world? I think a lot of people would argue that's the case. I haven't added any more shares of Microsoft since this recent sell-off, but I definitely don't plan on selling any shares, even though Microsoft is trading at an all-time high. Over the long term, one of the keys to having a chance to outperform the market is simply holding the best companies in the world, growing revenue, and free cash flow at high rates with high levels of return on invested capital, and of course, buying them at good valuations. And with my long-term goal to be one day to live off dividends, there's no doubt the ability for Microsoft to continue to grow their dividend at an extremely high rate continues to expand. So, go ahead and let me know what you think of Microsoft in the comments down below. If you plan on buying or selling, and like always, if you'd like to download any of these spreadsheets and also get access to the ticker data add-on in Google Sheets, allows you to automatically import stock financials straight into your spreadsheet, then you can head over to tickerdata.com at the link in the description.
