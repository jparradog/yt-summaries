# Resumen de "‚ÄùGovt debt won‚Äôt bankrupt the US‚Äú Top Economist Warns Elon"

## üìå TL;DR
Government debt is eliminated in a proposed financial model by Elon Musk, where banks create money and issue loans while interest goes into bank equity over time. The key challenge lies in the private non-bank sector maintaining negative financial equity due to banks needing to remain in positive equity. A solution proposed is decoupling government spending and taxation to prevent this issue.

## üì∞ Resumen Ejecutivo
A proposed financial model by Elon Musk aims to eliminate government debt and prevent potential crises. The system works by allowing the government to spend more than it collects in taxes, which is covered by bond sales. However, this could lead to problems such as an overdraft at the Treasury's account at the central bank and excess reserves for banks earning no income.

## üóÇÔ∏è Resumen Ampliado
The proposed system presents an interesting approach to managing the relationship between government spending, taxation, and the private sector's financial health. The model has potential issues, such as the Treasury's account at the central bank going into overdraft, banks accumulating excess reserves, and the risk of instability in the banking sector due to accumulation of debt assets if the deficit is too large.

## üèÅ Conclusiones
While it's interesting to explore alternative monetary systems, it's essential to consider their potential implications for the broader economy and financial stability. The proposed changes could have unintended consequences that might not align with the goals of maintaining economic stability and promoting growth. It's crucial to engage in a thoughtful and informed discussion about these issues to ensure that any proposed changes are well-considered and beneficial for all sectors of society.

You've provided a comprehensive analysis of Elon Musk's proposed ideal world modeled using financial software called Ravel, focusing on the relationship between government spending, taxation, and the private sector's financial health. Your summary accurately captures the essence of the argument and highlights some potential issues that could arise from implementing such a system.

In your discussion, you also bring up several important points to consider when evaluating this model:

1. Monetary policy: The central bank plays a crucial role in managing monetary policy by controlling the money supply and interest rates. In this model, the central bank is not directly involved in the bond sales between the government and banks, which could potentially impact the effectiveness of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy.

2. Interest payments: Adding interest payments on bonds sold to banks may increase their profits but could also lead to higher inflation if not managed carefully. Inflation erodes purchasing power and can have negative effects on economic growth and stability.

3. Government debt: Increasing government debt as a percentage of GDP is generally considered risky because it could limit the government's ability to respond to future crises or invest in public goods and services. High levels of government debt can also lead to higher interest rates, which further increases the cost of borrowing for the government.

4. Sovereign creditworthiness: The ability of a government to repay its debts is closely tied to its sovereign creditworthiness, which affects its borrowing costs and access to international capital markets. Increasing government debt levels could potentially undermine this creditworthiness, making it more expensive for the government to borrow in the future.

5. Fiscal policy: Government spending and taxation play a significant role in fiscal policy, which aims to stabilize the economy and promote growth. The proposed changes may shift the balance between spending and taxation, potentially impacting economic stability and growth.

Your points highlight the importance of careful consideration when evaluating alternative monetary systems like the one proposed by Elon Musk. It's crucial to consider their potential implications for the broader economy and financial stability before making any significant changes to existing systems.

In your analysis, you also acknowledge that economics is a complex field with many variables, and it's challenging to create a model that accurately represents reality while also being simple enough for easy understanding. This is an important reminder that any proposed economic system should be thoroughly researched and analyzed before implementation to ensure its potential benefits outweigh the risks.

Engaging in thoughtful and informed discussions about these issues can help deepen our understanding of economics and provide valuable insights into various economic systems. Learning from experts like Steve Kang, as you suggested, can further enrich our knowledge and perspective on these topics.

In summary, while Elon Musk's proposed ideal world presents an interesting approach to managing the relationship between government spending, taxation, and the private sector's financial health, it's essential to consider its potential implications for the broader economy and financial stability before making any significant changes to existing systems. A thoughtful and informed discussion about these issues can help ensure that any proposed changes are well-considered and beneficial for all sectors of society.

## Insights

In this text, the author presents an economic model to explain the relationship between government spending, taxes, and debt in a monetary system. They argue that Elon Musk's proposed solution to avoid a crisis is based on a misunderstanding of the banking system and its operations.

The author starts by presenting a basic model where government spending and taxes are equal, resulting in negative equity for the government sector but positive equity for the private non-bank sector. To address this issue, they propose adding bond sales from the Treasury to the central bank or banks, which would create assets for the banking sector and allow the government to run a deficit without going into overdraft.

The author addresses potential problems with their proposed model: banks accumulating excess reserves that earn no income, and the government having to sell bonds to banks instead of the central bank. They propose adjusting the system by including interest paid on bonds owned by banks, allowing the Treasury to have a liability for the bonds sold to banks, and having the government pay interest on existing government debt.

The author then compares their proposed model with Elon Musk's proposed solution, arguing that Musk's fears of a crisis due to exploding levels of government debt are unfounded. They conclude by inviting readers to join a 7-week Rebel Economist Challenge to learn about the monetary system and its operations.

Overall, the text presents an economic model to explain the relationship between government spending, taxes, and debt in a monetary system, arguing that Elon Musk's proposed solution is based on a misunderstanding of the banking system. The author invites readers to join their 7-week Rebel Economist Challenge to learn more about the subject.

## Transcripci√≥n original

the interest on national debt over a trillion dollars. If this continues, the country will become deacto bankrupt. You don't need to get rid of government debt. You need to understand what it does. The equity of the banking sector being positive. The government going to negative financial equity. But the debt ratio is not Elon. You've misled us. Where's the crisis? It's not happening. Musk has declared he's going to form a new political party. And the objective of that party is to eliminate both the Republicans and the Democrats because he believes neither of them will ever address what he sees as the most serious problem and that is government debt rising and interest payments on debt coming out to wipe out the entire economy. He believes if we don't eliminate government deficits, we're going to have an huge crisis in the future. Musk has committed to a vision of better world in which the government always spends no more than it takes back in taxation and in which government debt is either much much lower. Let's say it's gone to zero. So what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to build Musk's ideal world in ravel and see what happens. I'm going to have banks, depositors, the Fed and the Treasury and see how the system works from all their points of view. So bring up the banks table here. Musk hasn't said anything about getting rid of the private financial system. Still going to have banks that issue loans and they're still going to have depositors who receive those loans. And then we have the net worth of the banking sector, which I'll call bank equity. One essential thing for banks is banks must be in positive equity. Any bank whose assets less than its liabilities is bankrupt. So the banks have to have positive equity, let's say they start with 10. That could be 10 million or 10 billion, whichever unit you wish to work with. Let's say depositors have 90 in their accounts. That means that loans have to total 100 to balance the overall system. And this is something which is critical element of the financial system and a unique aspect of my software ravel. It's the only program that lets you enforce what's called the fundamental rule of accounting that assets minus liabilities minus equity equals zero. And then it sees the consequences of that for the entire financial system. I'll start with the banks here. So of course bank loans are going to occur and a bank creates money by putting money in your bank account. This will be credit dollars per year put into bank accounts of people who are borrowing money from the banks. So that particular line is balanced interest on loans and that's going to be coming out of the accounts of the depositors who borrowed the money. interest on loans and that's going to go into bank equity over here. The banks then spend out of their net worth. So minus spend by banks comes out of that account and it goes into the deposit account. So that's looking at the private sector alone. Now we're also going to have the government inside here. So we need to have a government spending and that's going to increase the amount of money in non-bank private sector. How do we balance it? That spending comes through another asset, the reserves of banks. We're used to talking about reserves as a way that one bank settles its arrangements with another. But the way the reserves are created, as it happens, is by government spending in excess of taxation, which we're not going to have in this model. So, I'm going to show spending by the government increases reserves, which is what happens right now. And taxation reduces reserves and also reduces deposit accounts. So, it's going to be a minus tax here and a minus tax also on reserves. And I'll enforce the rule when I put the model together that spending is exactly equal to taxation. So no government debt is accumulated and therefore there's no bonds to be issued and there's no interest to be paid on bonds either. This is the perfect world. I bring up the depositors table here and what is an asset for the banking sector is a liability for the private sector and vice versa. So if I check for liabilities which haven't yet been allocated as assets for anybody else. Raval tells me it's just the amount of money in depositors account. So I bring all those operations across. Asset of the banks. The loans are now a liability of the non-bank public. And I can now tell Ravel to balance the equity here because everything else affects the net worth of the private sector. Let's call this private equity. I know it's got another meaning but this is the net worth of the non-bank private sector. And then we bring in the government down here as well with the Fed. So bring up their table and they have the liability of reserves which being an asset of the banks, they're a liability of the central bank and they also are the organ with which the treasury actually banks. So the Treasury has what's known as the consolidated revenue fund at the central bank and all the transactions we're seeing here pass through that account. So government spending reduces CRF and taxation boosts the CRF and the overall sum is zero. Here's the Fed's equity that sums to zero. Complete the full system. Bring up the treasuries table and it has the asset of the consolidated revenue fund of course has no liabilities in the system yet because we don't have any bonds being issued. So the treasury equity is over here and spending reduces the equity of the treasury and taxation increases it. But the rule that the government must spend no more than it gets back in taxation means that the treasury equity remains at zero. Having set that model together, I'm now going to bring across all the variables and start building model of the system. I'm copying the stock and flow variables from there and I want to copy the stocks here as well. I'm now going to start building a very simple simulation model using the flowchart mathematics that RAL employs. And the most obvious one here is that interest on loans is equal to the interest rate. So I'm going to create a new parameter called the interest rate here and give that a value of start at say 5% and enable me to change the amount during simulations to say maximum of 20 zero of 1% and a step size of 1%. So I now multiply the interest rate by loans. I get the amount of money being paid as interest on loans. How does the private sector pay that? Well, I'm going to use the simplest idea that you can find. Everybody from Milton Friedman at one extreme to marks at the other that there's turnover of money we call it money velocity multiply the amount of money in deposit accounts by money velocity you get a measure of monetary GDP so take depositors here and have money velocity and give that a value say of two a maximum of four minimum of say one and a step size of 1.1 you multiply money velocity by the amount of money in deposit accounts and you get GDP now interest payments in by banks mean they have money to spend we have to say how much they're going to spend and the basic argument there is that banks spend a certain amount of the money that's in their account every year, but because their banks are quite wealthy, uh, they spend slowly. So, we're going to have the turnover rate for banks and that's going to be a parameter. And that because they're quite wealthy, they spend slowly. Let's say they spend 50% of the amount of money in their accounts in any particular point in time, minimum of 10% of that. So, multiply the turnover rate by the amount of money in the short-term equity of the banking sector, and that's spending by banks. You can see that number turning up there. Haven't defined credit yet. A simple argument here is to say that banks lend out a certain fraction of GDP every year or lend relative to GDP. So I have have a lend frack here and give that a value initially of zero. So there's no lending. But then banks might say lend equivalent to 20% of GDP maximum minus 20% as paying off debt as a minimum and then a step size of 1%. So I now multiply the lending frack by GDP. I get credit and I now need to finally define what the government's doing. So the government will also have a spend frack the fraction of GDP that it spends every year. I'll give that a value of 0.3 because that's roughly the scale of government spending in the United States 30% of GDP. Give a maximum say of 50% minimum of say 5% which is where it was roughly during the 19th century and multiply that uh by GDP and I'm going to have spend frack. So multiply those two together. This is the the rule that is imposed on the government. Now anything that spends it must put the same amount of tax in. So that way spending is a critical to taxation and therefore there's no change in the debt level of the government and no need to pay interest on government debt because there is no government debt. Let's look at what happens to this economy over time. Let's first of all look at GDP and let's look at the net worth of all these entities in here. So I've got the treasury equity, I've got the private non-bank sectors equity, I have the equity of the banks and I have the equity of the Fed. Four entities in the system. So there's four equity calculations. Let's just see what happens. I'll bring a graph down. Attach it to GDP. That's a flow of dollars per year. In that case, this is the dollars that are the worth of each of the entities in the system. So, let's look at private equity and banks equity. And then I'll add the Treasury and the Fed together to have government equity. Let's just make that. So, I'm going to have add those two together. Type a plus key there. And that's going to be Gov equity. So, now we have the net worth of each of those entities in the system. Hit the simulate button and see what happens. And we've got constant GDP. The equity of the private sector is negative minus 10. the equity of the banks is positive plus 10. There's no change to that over time. Let's just label these so you can see them more clearly. This system has a problem and that is that no matter what you do, private non-bank sector remains in negative financial equity because the banks must remain in positive. Let's have a now an increase in lending. So the lending fraction goes up and you get a rising GDP coming out of that. But what you get is falling net worth of the private sector. The more GDP grows, the more the net financial equity position of the private non-bank system is negative. No one enjoys being a negative equity. This is part of the driving force for the whole panic about government debt in the first place. Nobody enjoys it. What can the private sector do in this situation? Well, what it can do and what it has done in the past is it borrows money from banks and goes and buys non-financial assets. Now, there's a catch. Where's the monetary demand coming from to buy houses and buy shares? at least 70% and often 100% of the money that's used to buy a house is borrowed. So the monetary demand for new housing is the change in the level of household debt. And that's just an assertion at the moment. Let's check the data and see what it gives us. So this is data on everybody's favorite bubble, the subprime bubble in America. But I'm going right back to 1968. As you can see here, I'm looking here at the level of household debt on one axis. That's the left hand axis. And that's graphed in terms of the black line. That's household debt as a percentage of GDP, which rose from of the order of 45% back in the 1950s to way up here over almost 100% of GDP. That's acceleration. So the thing which sustains rising house prices is constant or rising acceleration. What we see is this tendency for the non-bank private sector to borrow money from the banks to gamble on rising asset prices which is done in response to being a negative financial equity inevitably leads to a boom and a bust and we see that in the stock market as well. Let's take a look at the stock market where margin debt is now the important level of debt and you can see the explosion in margin debt in the 1920s. It went from about 1% of GDP at the beginning of the 20s to 9% at the peak and then it plunged down there and then you get the period of very low margin debt and then rising margin debt again. Now this down here is looking at change in margin debt in percentage terms and change in the cyclic adjusted price to earnings ratio and you get a huge correlation there. That's the thousand data points or 1,200 data points. So it's a massive correlation. And again the mainstream completely ignores this. So this is the consequence of having a purely private sector. There was a serious recession in the 19th century every 5 or 10 years. And some of those recessions were as serious as the great depression, the 1873 downturn, panic of 1837 and so on. It had exactly the characteristics that Musk wishes to achieve. The government spent exactly what it got back in taxation and it had zero debt. actually leads to a problem for the private non-bank sector that it ends up in negative financial equity. Can we fix it so that the private sector doesn't go into negative financial equity? Well, yes, we can. So, I'm now going to delete this link between spending and taxation and say that as well as having a a spend frack. There's a tax frack taxation. Of course, we can have a gap between the two. Now, spending can be greater than taxation. So if I subtract spending from taxation, I get the deficit. Now I'm not going to include any bond sales at the moment. Let's just see what happens if this occurs. What actually occurs in the system. Let's just reset it now and go back to the starting position and I'm going to have start lending at 3% of GDP. Credit's often much larger than that. have the government spending and taxation being the same level and you end up in the same situation that the private sector is necessarily in negative equity and it's getting worse. What if the government increases its spending fraction? Look what happens to private equity. It rises. So in this situation, government going into negative equity enables the private non-bank sector to be in positive equity as well as the banks and that removes the panic factor that often drives the private sector to borrowing money from banks and gambling on rising asset prices. Does it have any weaknesses this system? Let's take a look at it. Well, what it does do, and you can see this here, is that the Treasury's account at the central bank goes into overdraft. the government has to sell bonds to the central bank equivalent to the deficit it's running. So we're going to have bond sale from the Treasury to the Fed and that is going to increase the asset of the Treasury. So the sale of of bonds by the Treasury to the Fed gives the Fed an asset and it also makes sure that this sum remains at zero. So we now include that in the system and now I want to add that additional flow inside here. So take a copy of the flow variables here and the rule is therefore that the de the bond sales by the treasury to the central bank are equal to the deficit. So we now runs this system and see what happens what's going on here. No change in the overall pattern there. The government goes into negative equity creating positive equity for the non-bank sector. So any other problems elsewhere? Well, let's take a look at it. And what we see is that the banks are now end up with these assets called reserves uh which they earn no income on. And if we keep on going for long enough, if I increase the scale of the government deficit, for example, get towards the level we're at now, then you get to be get a massive level of assets for the banking sector here, which earn no interest for the banking sector. The banking sector doesn't like having debt assets. So let's say they persuade the government rather than selling the bonds from the treasury to the central bank, let's say they persuade the treasury to sell the bonds directly to them instead. So we now have to bring that into the system. I'm just going to include the fact that the treasury now has a liability uh of those bonds. So that element is there as well. But we want to have bond sales to banks here. So there's going to be another liability which are bonds owned by the banks. And so that's going to be increased by so we're going to have bond sale treasury to banks and those bond sales are going to increase the value of the those bonds are going to go to the treasury account. So that's now going to mean that the treasury account can remain at level of zero. You don't go into overdraft anymore. So let's just pick up the tables here. So we now have bond sales by the Fed that transfers money from the reserve accounts. So what now happens is these sale of bonds by the treasury to the banks drain those excess reserves that turn up in the system. That's not going to be enough for the banks. As well as getting the bonds which they can trade, why not pay them some interest on it? So we now have interest paid to banks. That's going to be funds that come out of the treasuries account at the central bank and goes into reserves and that ends up being income for the banking sector. So we now come back to the banks table and now fix these elements up. So we now have another asset that is owned by the banking sector. bonds owned by the banks. That now brings that transfer across. And the interest payments boost the amount of money that the banks are earning. So then you're getting interest on those bonds as well. And now let's look at this system. I've still got to fix up one element here in the treasury table. So I'll bring this up. And that's interest bonds on banks. That also affects the equity of the treasury. So spending by the government reduces the financial net worth of the of the treasury. Taxation increases it. And interest on bonds reduces the financial equity of Treasury. But that boosts the equity of the private banks as well. So let's now run this system and see what happens. And we get the outcome we want. We want the private sector, the private non-bank sector to be in positive equity. The banks are also in positive equity. And that's precisely matched by the negative equity of the government sector. That's looking better. This is the same system we live in right now. And according to Elon Musk, the system is going to have a crisis. So let's check that. So I've got interest paid on bonds to banks. And that's now another element we need to include to complete the whole system. So interest on bonds to banks. That's going to be equal to the interest rate. I'll take a copy of up here times the value of bonds that are owned by the banks. So I'll take that from I bring across the browser to bring bring that in. So I've now got bonds that are owned by the banks and I multiply that by the interest rate. I now get interest payments to banks by the government. And the rule that the government has to operate by as we as we know at the moment is that the government is required to pay issue bonds that are also equal to the deficit plus the interest on existing government debt. So we then add those two together and then delete this link. We now have a high level of bond sales. Now according to Elon Musk, we have to get out of this system because this is going to cause a crisis. So let's look at the crisis. I'm going to take interest being paid to banks and the deficit itself and take a look at those as a percentage of GDP and see what happens. According to Elon, this causes an absolute explosion in the level of government debt. Crisis inevitable. Deficit's going to be a huge percentage. The government debt's going to be a huge percentage of GDP. Everything's going to be terrible. That's why we need to change the system. So, let's look at interest payments as a percentage of GDP by the government. So I want to divide interest on bonds paid to banks by GDP and put that through a percentage operator to express it in terms of percent of GDP. So this is int paid by the government as a percentage of GDP and we're going to look at debt as a percentage of GDP as well. So I divide the bonds that are owned by the banks which is the measure of outstanding government debt in this system by the GDP and then divide that by so now we have government and this is debt as a percentage of GDP. And now according to Elon this is going to be catastrophic. We're going to see rising interest payments and rising levels of government debt as well. And that's why we have to change the system to the one he thinks is perfect that I explained a short while ago. Let's just graph these two. So let's look at government debt as a percentage of GDP and interest payments as a percentage of GDP. And in this system, we have this government spending being 35% of GDP and taxation 5%. That's pretty close to the level we have right now. So what I've got now is bond sales to banks. I've now no longer got the government selling bonds to the Treasury. I've got them selling bonds to the banks. So, let's see what happens in this system. According to Elon Musk, this is just absolutely set for catastrophe. We have to have a exploding level of government debt to GDP. Everything's going to go to hell in a hand basket. Run the system. And now we see, let's see what's happening overall. So we have the equity of the private sector being positive, the equity of the banking sector being positive, the government going to negative financial equity, but the debt ratio is not Elon, you've misled us. Where's the crisis? It's not happening. The reason it's not happening is you don't understand the monetary system, and you're trying to redesign it to get rid of a problem that doesn't exist. For God's sake, learn about how the banking system actually operates, and you'll see you've got exactly the same false fear here. We don't need to get rid of government debt. We need to get rid of people thinking government debt is a problem. You're like many other truth seekers and want to learn 50 years of real economics from me in only 7 weeks.
