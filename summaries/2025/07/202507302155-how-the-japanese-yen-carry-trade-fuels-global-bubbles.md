# Resumen de "How the Japanese Yen "Carry Trade" Fuels Global Bubbles"

TL;DR:

The Japanese Yen "Carry Trade" refers to borrowing cheaply in Japan (using the Japanese Yen) and investing in higher-yield assets in other countries, but it can lead to currency instability if the yen weakens too sharply due to large outflows of capital. The risks associated with this strategy include a tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), changes in global interest rates, geopolitical or financial shocks that cause a flight to safe havens, Japan's own economic health, and potential regime changes in global capital flows. These risks can lead to the unwinding of carry trade positions, which can be painful and self-reinforcing.

   - Japanese Yen "Carry Trade" – The practice of borrowing low-interest yen to invest in higher-yielding assets such as U.S. dollars or other currencies.

   Resumen Ejecutivo:
   The Japanese Yen Carry Trade is a financial strategy that involves borrowing cheaply in Japan and investing in higher-yield assets abroad, but it can lead to currency instability if the yen weakens too sharply due to large outflows of capital. The risks associated with this strategy include changes in global interest rates, geopolitical or financial shocks, Japan's own economic health, and potential regime changes in global capital flows.

   Resumen Ampliado:
   The Japanese Yen Carry Trade has been a significant factor in global financial markets for decades, but it can be volatile due to various risks. One risk is the tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which could lead to an unwinding of carry trade positions and cause economic pain. Another risk is changes in global interest rates, as a narrowing of interest rate differentials could reduce the advantage of borrowing yen to invest in higher-yielding assets abroad. Geopolitical or financial shocks that cause a flight to safe havens can also disrupt the carry trade. Additionally, Japan's own economic health and potential regime changes in global capital flows are factors to consider when evaluating the risks of the Japanese Yen Carry Trade.

## Insights

This text discusses the yen carry trade, a financial strategy involving borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets in other countries. The author argues that while the yen carry trade has been influential in global financial markets, it is not the sole cause of asset price bubbles and should not be overstated as an all-powerful boogeyman.

The text highlights several reasons for this perspective:
1. Global bubbles have multiple causes, and low Japanese rates are just one factor.
2. Central banks today are more aware and better prepared to handle carry trade volatility than in the past.
3. Japan's own policy shifts may be very gradual, which might allow carry traders time to adjust their positions without a full-blown panic.

However, the text also acknowledges that serious risks remain on the horizon:
1. BOJ Policy Reversal: If Japan decisively ends its negative-rate policy and raises rates meaningfully, it could send the yen soaring and catch carry traders off guard.
2. Global Inflation or Rate Shifts Elsewhere: Changes in interest rate differentials between countries could rapidly alter the incentives for carry trades.
3. Safe-Haven Shock (Geopolitical or Financial Crisis): A major geopolitical or financial shock that sends everyone fleeing to safe havens could trigger a yen-funded carry position implosion.
4. Japan's Economic Health: If Japan falls back into deep deflation and growth stagnation, the BOJ might keep money ultra-cheap indefinitely, encouraging even more carry trade buildup (and thus future bubbles). Conversely, if Japan achieves sustained growth and inflation, it would transform the yen from a funding currency to perhaps an investment currency.

In conclusion, while the yen carry trade is a significant factor in global financial markets, it should not be considered the sole cause of asset price bubbles. The risks associated with the carry trade are real but manageable, as long as central banks remain vigilant and prepared for potential volatility. However, sudden changes in macroeconomic conditions or geopolitical events could still trigger a rapid unwinding of yen-funded carry positions.

## Transcripción original

In early August 2024, something eerie swept 
through global markets. Virtually overnight, the   Japanese yen – a currency that had been quietly 
weakening for months – surged in value by over 10%   against the U.S. dollar. Stock prices from Tokyo 
to New York buckled as panicked traders raced to   unwind their positions. Billions of dollars in 
seemingly “safe” bets unraveled within hours.   It was as if an invisible force in finance had 
suddenly snapped, jolting the world economy.   What on earth just happened? The answer lies in 
a long-standing, little-understood strategy often   likened to financial “dark matter” – unseen but 
immensely powerful. It’s called the Japanese yen   carry trade. For decades, this obscure maneuver 
quietly pumped cheap money out of Japan and into   riskier assets around the globe. It has helped 
inflate property booms in places like Australia   and fueled stock and bond bubbles from New 
York to Istanbul. Now that invisible force is   shuddering. How did a lowly Japanese interest 
rate become the fuel for global bubbles? What   exactly is the yen carry trade, and why does 
it hold the power to rock economies on multiple   continents? And most importantly – what happens 
if this house of cards comes crashing down? To understand the yen carry trade, we first need 
to understand why Japan’s money became so cheap   in the first place. Flash back to the 1980s: 
Japan’s economy was on fire, with its stock   market and real estate prices soaring to dizzying 
heights. This “bubble economy” eventually burst   spectacularly around 1990, plunging Japan into 
a severe recession. In response, the Bank of   Japan (BOJ) slashed interest rates dramatically 
in the 1990s, trying to spur growth and fight   off deflation. By 1999, the BOJ’s policy interest 
rate was effectively zero – the start of Japan’s   now decades-long experiment with ultra‐easy money.
For perspective, while U.S. or European interest   rates fluctuated over the years, Japan’s stayed 
near 0% (even dipping slightly negative to -0.1%   in 2016). The BOJ kept rates at rock-bottom 
to jumpstart the stalled economy and encourage   borrowing. But an unintended side effect was that 
money in Japan became practically free to borrow.   Imagine walking into a Tokyo bank and getting a 
loan at 0.5% interest – it sounds like a dream. In   Japan, for many years that was close to reality.
With few good returns at home, Japanese investors   began casting their gaze abroad. By the early 
2000s, they faced what one analyst called “zero   yields at home”, so they ploughed trillions of yen 
into foreign markets in search of better returns.   This flood of outbound investment turned Japan 
into the world’s biggest creditor nation. In fact,   as of early 2024, Japanese investors held roughly 
¥667 trillion in foreign stocks and bonds – about   $4.5 trillion USD – more than half of that in 
overseas bonds and debt assets. These enormous   capital outflows from Japan created the perfect 
conditions for the yen carry trade to thrive. At its heart, the yen carry trade is a 
straightforward money-making maneuver.   The idea is simple: borrow money in a country 
with very low interest rates (like Japan),   and invest that money in a country with higher 
interest rates. The profit comes from the interest   rate differential. If done correctly, it’s almost 
like free money – like borrowing cash at a cheap   rate in one place and watching it earn a higher 
rate somewhere else. This strategy isn’t limited   to big banks or hedge funds; it’s been popular 
with all sorts of players, from Wall Street   traders to multinational companies and even 
ordinary individuals funding their mortgages.  Let’s break down how a typical 
yen carry trade works in practice:  Borrow Low-Interest Yen: A trader first 
borrows a large sum of Japanese yen at   Japan’s ultralow interest 
rate. Thanks to BOJ policy,   yen loans might cost almost nothing in interest 
– for example, an annual rate around 0.5%. Convert to Higher-Yield Currency: The trader 
immediately converts those yen into a different   currency from a country where interest 
rates are higher. In the 2000s and 2010s,   favorites included the U.S. dollar, 
Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar,   Turkish lira, Indonesian rupiah, Mexican peso 
– basically any currency with a juicy yield. Invest for Higher Return: The funds are 
then invested in assets denominated in that   higher-yielding currency. This could be government 
or corporate bonds, stocks, real estate, or even   just deposited in a bank to earn interest. The 
key is that the target investment might yield,   say, 5–10% annually, while the cost of the 
yen loan remains near 0%. For instance,   at one point an investor could borrow yen at 
~0.5% and buy a safe U.S. Treasury bond yielding   ~5.5% – pocketing an easy 5% profit margin minus 
hedging costs. Multiply that by millions or   billions of dollars, often using leverage, 
and the carry trade looks very lucrative. Profit – As Long as Nothing Changes: As time 
goes on, the trader collects the higher interest   from the foreign investment and periodically 
pays the negligible interest on the yen loan,   profiting from the difference. If the yen 
stays weak or depreciates further against the   target currency, there’s a bonus: when converting 
back, the borrowed yen are cheaper to repay. This   enhances profits even more. In an ideal scenario, 
the trader eventually converts the foreign assets   back into yen at a favorable exchange rate, 
repays the yen loan, and keeps the profit. It sounds like a money-printing machine, and 
for a while it can be. In fact, annualized   returns of 5–6% or more have been typical on yen 
carry trades in recent years – roughly the gap   between U.S. and Japanese interest rates. Some yen 
carry plays have been even more lucrative if the   exchange rate moved favorably during the trade.
However, there’s a catch (and it’s a big one):   the whole strategy only works “if all goes 
well,” as traders like to say. The biggest   risk is currency fluctuation. Because the trader 
eventually must convert foreign currency back to   yen to repay the loan, any sharp rise in the yen’s 
value can wipe out the profit margin or even cause   huge losses. In other words, the exchange rate 
risk looms over every carry trade. If the yen   strengthens unexpectedly, the trader will need 
more of the foreign currency (dollars, lira,   etc.) to buy back the yen owed – potentially 
erasing that interest differential gain.  Carry traders typically bank on stability 
– they seek out times of low volatility and   predictable central bank policies. That’s why 
Japan’s long-standing predictability (years   of zero rates and anemic growth) made the yen 
a favorite funding currency. But if something   upsets that stability, the exits can get crowded 
fast. A veteran Japanese trader once warned:   when a “crowded trade” like the yen carry 
starts to unwind, everyone tries to get out   of the pool at once, and the rush for the exits 
can be “swift and violent”. In those moments,   the benign carry trade morphs into a 
stampede, as we’ll see in real examples. The yen carry trade isn’t just a 
theoretical concept – it’s played   out dramatically in real markets. Let’s 
explore a few vivid examples to see how this   works and how it sometimes goes terribly wrong:
Boom and Bust in the Australian Dollar: Australia,   with its historically higher interest rates and 
resource-fueled economy, has long been a prime   target for yen-funded carry trades. In the early 
2000s, many investors borrowed yen at near-zero   rates and used it to buy Australian dollars and 
Australian assets. This “Aussie carry trade” was   highly profitable between 2003 and 2007, as the 
Aussie dollar consistently appreciated against the   yen instead of falling as theory might predict. 
Not only were investors earning higher interest   on Australian bonds or deposits, but their Aussie 
dollars were gaining value relative to the yen,   amplifying returns. By mid-2007, these 
traders were sitting on sizable gains.   It looked like a one-way bet… until it wasn’t. 
When the global financial crisis hit in 2008,   risk sentiment reversed violently. The Australian 
dollar plunged in value (falling sharply against   the yen), and in a matter of months it wiped 
out years of accumulated carry trade profits.   What went up came crashing down. Those who had 
gotten too comfortable were reminded why the   carry trade’s gains are sometimes described as 
“picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.” The Turkish Lira Temptation: In the 2010s, Japan’s 
proverbial Mrs. Watanabe (a nickname for Japanese   retail investors) found a new love: Turkish lira 
bonds. Turkey’s interest rates were very high   – for example, around 7% or more on government 
bonds – at a time when Japan’s were near 0%. That   interest gap was too delicious for yield-hungry 
Japanese households to ignore. They poured money   into lira-denominated assets, effectively engaging 
in the carry trade from their living rooms. By   2018, the Turkish lira had become hugely popular 
with Japanese retail traders. One could borrow yen   cheaply and earn a fat yield in lira, boosting 
returns on personal savings. Many even looked   past Turkey’s creeping inflation and President 
Erdogan’s unorthodox economic policies because   the interest payoff seemed worth the risk. But 
this story, too, ended in tears. In August 2018,   a diplomatic spat between Turkey and the U.S. 
triggered a colossal sell-off in the lira. The   currency plummeted over 13% in just days. Japanese 
mom-and-pop investors who had been “buying the   dip” on lira suddenly saw their positions collapse 
in value. Data from Tokyo showed Japanese traders   cut their lira holdings by a record amount in one 
day, scrambling to stop the bleeding. The formerly   high-yielding lira had turned into a trap. As one 
analyst quipped, “They had been buying on dips,   but the fall was too large to stomach”. Many also 
rushed to dump their other favorite high-yield   plays, like the South African rand, which only 
exacerbated those currency drops. The Turkish   saga showed how quickly a carry trade can 
unravel when an external shock hits a target   country – and how the fallout can even roil other 
markets (like the rand) as investors cut losses. Mortgages and Emerging Markets: It’s not only 
professional traders or investors benefiting from   Japan’s cheap money. Over the years, there have 
been cases of individuals and companies around the   world taking out loans in yen to fund projects 
or purchases at home. For example, in some   emerging markets or Eastern European countries, 
borrowers once obtained yen-denominated or Swiss   franc–denominated mortgages because the interest 
rates were far lower than local currency loans.   This is effectively a carry trade in personal 
finance – you borrow in yen at, say, 1%,   to fund a house purchase where local mortgages 
would cost 5%. It works nicely until the yen’s   value rises. When the yen strengthens, 
suddenly the amount you owe (in local   currency terms) balloons, even if your interest 
rate was low. Many such borrowers learned the   hard way that a cheap yen loan can become very 
expensive if the exchange rate moves. In fact,   even companies in Asia participated historically 
– during the 1990s, some firms in Thailand,   Indonesia, and South Korea borrowed in yen or 
dollars to capitalize on lower foreign rates.   When the Asian Financial Crisis struck in 1997 and 
local currencies collapsed, those yen debts became   crippling. It was another reminder: the carry 
trade giveth, and the carry trade taketh away. Each of these examples illustrates a 
common pattern. The yen carry trade can   quietly pump up asset prices and currencies – 
Australians enjoyed an influx of investment,   Turkey enjoyed lots of Japanese buyers for 
its bonds – creating a sense of stability or   even euphoria on the way up. The “bubble” builds 
almost imperceptibly. But when conditions change,   the reversal can be sudden and severe. 
We’ll now turn to how these flows have   contributed to broader asset bubbles 
and market instability over time. The yen carry trade has been implicated in 
inflating asset-price bubbles across the world   during periods of abundant liquidity. When money 
is essentially free to borrow in Japan, it tends   to flow outward and find homes in higher-yield 
or speculative investments abroad. By amplifying   global liquidity, the yen carry trade has at times 
added extra froth to markets already on the rise.  Consider the mid-2000s, a period often remembered 
for various booming markets – U.S. housing prices   surging, stock markets climbing, and a feverish 
hunt for yield globally. Japan had kept rates at   rock-bottom after its late-90s ZIRP (Zero Interest 
Rate Policy), and by the early 2000s the country   was still mired in deflation. Japanese yen was 
cheap. This coincided with a voracious appetite   among investors worldwide for higher returns, 
leading to a massive yen carry trade build-up.   By 2007, the yen had weakened to around ¥125 per 
US$ – reflecting investors heavily selling yen   to buy higher-yield assets. While it’s hard 
to get exact figures (these trades aren’t   neatly reported on any single balance sheet), some 
estimates put the scale of yen carry positions in   the hundreds of billions of dollars by the eve of 
the 2008 global financial crisis. In other words,   a vast pool of borrowed yen was fueling asset 
purchases worldwide, from U.S. subprime mortgage   bonds to European stocks and emerging-market 
loans. It was a hidden accelerant behind the   bubble-like asset inflation of that era.
However, just as dark matter in space is   only obvious when something disturbs it, the yen 
carry trade’s presence became dramatically evident   when the bubble began to burst. In 2007–2008, as 
cracks formed in the global financial system, risk   sentiment flipped. The seemingly endless appetite 
for risk gave way to a panicked flight to safety.   And one of the safest havens? The Japanese yen. 
Investors who had bet against the yen suddenly   rushed to buy yen back – either to close their 
carry trade positions or simply as a safe store   of value. This caused a vicious feedback loop: 
as global markets tumbled, carry traders dumped   their risky assets and repatriated funds into 
yen, driving the yen’s value sharply higher,   which in turn made remaining carry trades even 
more unprofitable, forcing more liquidation.  The scale of this unwinding during the 2008 
meltdown was stunning. The dollar–yen exchange   rate, which had been around ¥120–125 per US$ 
in mid-2007, plunged to about ¥87 per US$ by   late 2008. That’s roughly a 30% appreciation of 
the yen in a matter of months – an enormous move   for a major currency. For context, a year’s worth 
of interest differential gains (maybe 5–10%) was   wiped out in days by the exchange rate swing. 
Anyone in a yen carry trade saw their profits   evaporate and potentially turn into painful 
losses. The rapid unwinding of the yen carry   trade didn’t cause the global financial crisis 
(that root cause was subprime mortgages and   banking leverage), but it poured fuel on the fire. 
As one retrospective analysis noted, the yen carry   trade’s collapse worsened the 2008 global market 
meltdown. The forced unwinding contributed to the   extreme volatility: when the yen surged and carry 
traders ran for cover, it added extra downward   pressure on stock and commodity prices worldwide.
Japan itself was not spared from this whiplash.   The yen’s spike hammered Japan’s export-heavy 
economy – suddenly Japanese goods were much   more expensive overseas, just as global demand 
was cratering. In fact, during the 2008 crisis   Japan’s economy suffered the worst contraction 
among G7 nations. A strong yen was the last   thing Japan needed in a recession, yet that’s 
precisely what the carry trade unwind delivered.  Fast-forward to the 2010s: the yen carry 
trade went through lulls and revivals.   In the early 2010s, the yen actually strengthened 
to record highs (around ¥75–80 per US$ by 2011)   as a result of global risk aversion and Japan’s 
own economic woes. But then came a new chapter:   Abenomics. Starting in 2013, Prime Minister Shinzo 
Abe and the BOJ launched aggressive easing – QQE   (Quantitative and Qualitative Easing) – aiming 
to finally break deflation. The BOJ flooded the   market with yen, and the currency began a 
steep decline from 2013 onward. By 2015,   the yen had weakened significantly, and Japan 
was again a premier source of cheap funding.   This reenergized the carry trade, now not 
just through banks but also via algorithmic   funds and global investors seeing an easy play. 
Observers noted that the yen carry trade in the   2013–2019 period kicked off in a big way, since 
U.S. rates started rising (the Federal Reserve   hiked rates in the late 2010s) while Japan stayed 
ultra-loose. The interest rate divergence was   back, and so was the carry. Japanese cash 
flowed into higher-yield corporate bonds,   emerging market debt, and equities worldwide.
By 2022–2023, the yen carry trade arguably reached   new heights – some called it “gargantuan”. 
Why? Because the divergence hit an extreme:   the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked U.S. interest 
rates from near zero to over 5% in 2022-23 to   fight inflation, while the BOJ still pegged 
its short-term rate around -0.1% and capped   long-term yields. The result: a massive 5%+ 
interest gap between yen and dollar yields.   The yen also plunged in value during this time 
(at one point losing over 20% against the dollar   in 2022 alone), making yen borrowing even more 
attractive. Traders could borrow yen practically   for free and buy U.S. Treasuries, earning a hefty 
yield. Or invest in Indian or Indonesian bonds,   or tech stocks – almost anything offering higher 
returns. By mid-2023, yen-funded trades had   quietly permeated many corners of global markets; 
it was like an ocean current, subtly lifting asset   prices. Some market commentators even suggested 
that the rally in U.S. tech stocks and crypto in   2023 was partly juiced by yen-funded liquidity, 
though that’s hard to prove definitively.   What’s clear is that Japanese institutions and 
individuals alike were pouring money abroad:   Japan’s foreign portfolio investment hit record 
highs. Trillions of yen were sluicing into global   assets, often unhedged, in pursuit of yield.
This brings us full circle to 2024,   the episode we opened with. After years of easy 
money, inflation started creeping up in Japan   (for once!). By mid-2023 into 2024, prices were 
rising enough that the BOJ began hinting it might   finally tighten policy. In late July 2024, in a 
surprise move, the BOJ adjusted its yield-curve   control and nudged interest rates slightly higher. 
That tiny policy tweak – raising a benchmark rate   to 0.25% from essentially 0% – and some tough 
talk about possible further hikes sent a shock   through the complacent ranks of carry traders. 
The yen suddenly reversed its long decline and   started strengthening fast. In the first week 
of August 2024, as mentioned, the yen’s spike   triggered a rapid unwind of yen-funded trades 
across the world. It was like a mini replay of   2008 (though far more contained). Stocks dipped 
sharply, especially sectors that had benefitted   from abundant cheap liquidity. Tech stocks and 
even cryptocurrencies – some of the riskiest,   most leveraged assets – wobbled as that 
tide of cheap yen receded. One analysis   noted that the most dramatic drops were seen 
in areas like U.S. momentum stocks and crypto,   which “hardly the reaction investors 
would normally expect” – suggesting the   yen carry trade had been quietly propping them up.
Within days, Japanese officials scrambled to calm   markets. A BOJ deputy governor publicly reassured 
that the bank “will not raise rates further if   there is market turmoil,” trying to put the genie 
back in the bottle. This succeeded in stemming the   yen’s rise for the moment – the yen gave back some 
gains and stock markets rebounded by mid-August   2024. Yet, the episode was a stark warning: the 
yen carry trade had grown into a huge, invisible   bubble-maker, and even the smallest pinprick 
from the BOJ could send shockwaves through   global markets. Like a finely tuned orchestra, 
the world’s asset prices had been marching to   the quiet drumbeat of the BOJ’s zero-rate policy. 
Change that tune, and the dancers can stumble. Why does all this matter beyond the 
esoterica of currency trades? Because   the yen carry trade affects us all – it’s a 
key part of the plumbing of global finance.   Think of the yen carry trade as a giant siphon, 
drawing money from where it’s cheap (Japan) and   spraying it into asset markets worldwide. When 
that spray is steady, it pushes up asset prices,   compresses yields, and often suppresses 
volatility. It’s one reason interest rates on   things like U.S. or Australian bonds may have been 
lower than they otherwise would: Japanese demand   kept yields down. It’s one reason stock markets 
had extra fuel: cheap leverage from Japan found   its way into equities. In good times, this extra 
liquidity can reinforce optimism – a virtuous   cycle of rising prices begetting more risk-taking.
However, this comes at a cost: it can make bubbles   bigger. Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Ben Bernanke once referred to a “global savings   glut” keeping rates low; in a similar vein, 
one could argue there has been a “global   carry glut” – an excess of cheap borrowed yen 
sloshing around. The Economist back in 2007   presciently warned that the yen carry trade was 
inflating asset-price bubbles across the world.   When Japanese housewives can influence the 
South African rand’s value from their kitchen,   and when a minor tweak in Tokyo’s policy can 
cause a flash crash in New York, it’s clear   we’re dealing with a deeply interconnected system.
One could call the yen carry trade financial dark   matter. Just as dark matter in astrophysics is 
invisible yet holds galaxies together with its   gravity, the yen carry trade is largely unseen 
(few headlines scream “Yen Carry Trade Flows   Today!”) yet it quietly holds up markets 
– until it suddenly doesn’t. Importantly,   like dark matter, it’s hard to measure directly. 
Even experts can only estimate the size of carry   trade positions. A Reuters analysis in 2024 noted 
“no one is quite sure” how large the yen carry   trade truly is. One rough proxy was the short-term 
external loans by Japanese banks – about $350   billion – which could be tied to yen-funded 
trades. But that might vastly understate things,   since it doesn’t count positions taken by 
global hedge funds or the trillions of yen   Japanese investors have plowed into longer-term 
foreign investments. Furthermore, leverage   (through derivatives, currency forwards, etc.) can 
amplify the real exposure beyond what simple loan   data show. In short, we often only see the carry 
trade’s footprints after the fact – when a sudden   move in the yen or a crisis forces it to unwind.
For other countries, the yen carry trade can be a   double-edged sword. On one hand, capital inflows 
from Japanese investors can be beneficial.   They finance government deficits (e.g. 
foreigners buying Indonesian or Mexican bonds),   buoy stock markets, and sometimes contribute to 
economic growth by lowering financing costs. Many   emerging economies have welcomed global investors 
(including Japanese) buying their high-yield   bonds; it’s a source of funding. Even developed 
markets like Australia benefited – Japanese   demand for Aussie dollar assets helped keep 
Australian interest rates relatively low and   supported the currency during boom times.
On the other hand, these flows can create   a false sense of security. They can lead to 
currency overvaluation and asset bubbles that   aren’t supported by local economic fundamentals. 
And if the tide turns – say, Japan’s rates rise,   or a global shock sends investors rushing home 
– those countries can see abrupt outflows.   The result might be a sudden asset price collapse 
or currency crisis. For instance, some analysts   have speculated: what happens if Japanese yields 
rise enough that Japanese institutions sell their   U.S. Treasuries and other foreign holdings en 
masse to invest back home? It could send U.S.   bond yields higher and weaken currencies like the 
dollar or Australian dollar as money “sucks” back   to Japan. In 2023–25, we’ve started to see hints 
of this: as Japan signals tightening, there’s   concern that the “loud sucking sound” could be 
global liquidity draining out, back to Tokyo.   In ASEAN countries, economists have been weighing 
whether they can weather a potential yen carry   trade reversal – essentially, are their financial 
systems resilient if Japanese capital pulls back?  In global forums, Japanese officials have often 
faced questions (and sometimes complaints) about   the yen carry trade’s impact. Interestingly, 
Japanese policymakers for years took a sanguine   view of it. As long as it reflected market choices 
and didn’t destabilize the yen too much, they were   mostly hands-off. After all, with Japan’s economy 
sluggish, who could blame Japanese investors for   seeking yield abroad? However, their tune changes 
when the carry trade threatens to disrupt Japan’s   own currency too sharply. We saw multiple direct 
interventions by Japan in 2022 and 2023 to prop   up a free-falling yen. In effect, Japan was fine 
with exporting capital – until the resulting yen   weakness became too extreme (fueling import 
inflation at home). It’s a delicate balance.  Counterpoints and Risks: Is the Party Ending?
Not everyone is convinced that the yen carry   trade is an all-powerful boogeyman. Skeptics 
offer a few counterpoints worth considering:  First, they argue that global bubbles have 
multiple causes, and low Japanese rates are   just one factor. The U.S. housing bubble, for 
example, had a lot to do with U.S. interest rates,   lax regulation, and financial engineering – not 
only yen carry trades. Similarly, stock market   bubbles often coincide with technological hype 
cycles or corporate earnings growth. In this view,   the yen carry trade amplifies trends 
but doesn’t create them from scratch.   It’s part of a broader ecosystem of easy money 
that includes U.S. Federal Reserve policy,   European banks, and more. For instance, during 
the 2020-2021 pandemic stimulus period, it wasn’t   Japanese money but rather Fed-driven liquidity 
that arguably led the charge in inflating asset   prices. So, some say we shouldn’t overstate 
the yen carry trade’s role – it’s important,   yes, but it’s one piece of a complex puzzle.
Second, central banks today are more aware and   better prepared to handle carry trade volatility 
than in the past. After the chaos of 2008,   regulators beefed up surveillance of cross-border 
flows and bank exposures. Many emerging markets   now maintain higher foreign exchange reserves 
and employ macroprudential measures to guard   against sudden outflows. As one analyst noted, 
compared to 2008, authorities today are “more   engaged in intervening in currency markets, 
which could mitigate the impact of carry   trade unwinding.” In other words, if a rush of 
yen appreciation starts destabilizing markets,   we might see coordinated responses – like 
central banks cutting rates elsewhere,   or Japan smoothing the currency moves with 
intervention. Indeed, when the yen spiked in 2024,   the BOJ quickly communicated a dovish stance to 
calm the waters. And in previous episodes (e.g.,   2011’s yen surge post-Fukushima disaster), G7 
finance ministers coordinated to stabilize the   yen. This implies that while the carry trade can 
cause abrupt pain, global financial authorities   won’t be caught completely off guard. 
The safety nets are stronger (one hopes).  Third, some analysts point out that Japan’s own 
policy shifts may be very gradual. The BOJ has   been ultra-dovish for so long that it will likely 
move cautiously to avoid economic harm at home. If   Japan only raises rates slowly and modestly, the 
carry trade might unwind in an orderly fashion   rather than a sudden crash. In late 2024, 
even after the BOJ’s slight hawkish turn,   the yen’s value, while higher, was still weak by 
historical standards (hovering around ¥140–150   per USD, compared to ¥100 or stronger in earlier 
eras). This suggests the “correction” may have   more to run but perhaps over a period of years, 
not overnight. In fact, one prominent economist   forecast in 2024 that the yen might revert to a 
“fair value” of around ¥115 per USD over the next   three years – a significant strengthening, but 
not a disorderly one. If that gradual path holds,   carry traders would have time to adjust 
their positions without a full-blown panic.  That said, serious risks remain on the horizon:
BOJ Policy Reversal: The biggest risk to the   carry trade is the BOJ fully normalizing monetary 
policy. If Japan decisively ends its negative-rate   policy and raises rates meaningfully, the 
fundamental arithmetic of the carry trade   flips. Japanese yen would no longer be the 
ultra-cheap funding it once was. Already,   Japan ended its negative rate era by moving to a 
0% to 0.1% range in late 2023, and there is talk   of further hikes as inflation has perked up. A 
faster-than-expected tightening (for instance,   if inflation in Japan surprises to the upside) 
could send the yen soaring and catch carry traders   off guard. The proverbial “carry trade party” 
would truly be over. This scenario would test   global markets’ resilience – remember that 
even a 0.25% tweak rattled stocks in 2024.   A larger, concerted BOJ tightening could trigger 
a much bigger unwinding of positions globally. Global Inflation or Rate Shifts Elsewhere: Another 
risk is if interest rate differentials narrow from   the other side – say the U.S. Federal Reserve 
or European Central Bank cut their rates sharply   (due to recession) while Japan holds steady or 
only inches up. In that case, the advantage of   borrowing yen to invest in dollars diminishes. 
Some carry trades might unwind simply because   the yield pickup shrinks. We could actually 
see the opposite flows: if, hypothetically,   U.S. rates fell below Japan’s, investors might 
borrow dollars to invest in yen assets – a   reversal known as the “reverse carry trade.” 
While that scenario isn’t likely in the near term,   the point is that changing macro conditions can 
rapidly alter the incentives for carry trades. Safe-Haven Shock (Geopolitical or Financial 
Crisis): Perhaps the most unpredictable risk   is a major geopolitical or financial shock that 
sends everyone fleeing to safe havens. The yen,   famously, is a safe-haven currency. In 
times of global panic – be it a war,   a pandemic resurgence, or a severe credit crisis 
– the yen tends to strengthen as investors around   the world seek stability. This happened in 
past episodes like the 1997 Asian crisis,   2008 crisis, and briefly in early 2020 (COVID’s 
onset) and could happen again. If something   sparks a sudden risk-off wave, yen-funded carry 
positions would implode as the yen spikes. The   paradox is that what was once the cheap funding 
currency becomes the refuge. For carry traders,   that is the nightmare scenario: not only 
are the risky assets falling in value,   but the yen loan they owe is surging in value 
simultaneously – a double hit. Such an unwind   can be self-reinforcing and painful, as we 
saw. Geopolitical instability (for example,   an expansion of conflict in Eastern Europe or 
East Asia) could trigger this kind of chain   reaction even if unrelated to economics. The “dark 
matter” could swiftly turn into dark storm clouds. Japan’s Economic Health: There’s also the 
chance that Japan’s own economic trajectory   surprises in either direction. If Japan falls 
back into deep deflation and growth stagnation,   the BOJ might keep money ultra-cheap indefinitely, 
encouraging even more carry trade buildup (and   thus future bubbles). Conversely, if Japan 
finally achieves sustained growth and inflation,   it would transform the yen from a funding currency 
to perhaps an investment currency. That could   fundamentally alter global capital flows in 
ways we haven’t seen in a generation. Either   scenario would be a regime change from the status 
quo, and big regime changes tend to be bumpy. In short, while many are aware of the risks and 
prepare for them, the yen carry trade remains a   precariously balanced phenomenon. It’s like a huge 
spring that’s been coiled by years of low rates   – compressing more and more – and one wonders how 
much energy will release when that spring uncoils.
